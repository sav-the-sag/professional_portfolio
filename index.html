              Savannah is a graduate from Saint Mary's College of California where she studied theology and religion. After a few years diving into the world of Christian history and various faith practices, she yearned for a change. In 2023 Savannah switched her focus to web development and joined UC Berkeley's coding boot camp.

              In her spare time Savannah likes to watch movies, play video games, and hang out with her friends. Her favorite season is winter, as that is when her birthday and favorite holiday, Christmas, occur. Savannah could never say no to a cup of chai or to her dog, Finnick.
